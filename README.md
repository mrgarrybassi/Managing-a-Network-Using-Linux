# Managing-a-Network-Using-Linux
This project is a step by step guide that explains how to set up, manage, and troubleshoot a network on Linux Machine.

**PROJECT**

Managing a network simply means setting up, administering and
troubleshooting a network. Basically, the purpose of a computer network
is to share the resources (files and documents) on other devices,
hardware devices (for example - printers) and to be able to communicate
within and with other networks. Network management can be done using
different operating systems like Microsoft Windows Server, Novell Open
Enterprise Server, Linux Based OS like Ubuntu server, openSUSE, etc.
Mostly all the OS used for network management can achieve the same
functionalities.

In this project we have chosen to work on a LINUX based OS. LINUX based
OS is also very popular among big companies like Oracle, IBM, and
Amazon.
